# Streamlining Development Workflows with Claude Code Custom Commands

I recently discovered a game-changing feature in Claude Code that I had to share: custom slash commands. After spending countless hours repeating the same version management tasks across different projects, I decided to dive deep into this feature and create my own semantic versioning command. What I found was a flexible system that has completely transformed how I handle routine development tasks.

## The Problem: Repetitive Version Management

Like many developers, I found myself constantly going through the same tedious process for version releases:

1. Check if the working directory is clean
2. Read the current version from a VERSION file
3. Increment the version according to semantic versioning rules
4. Update the VERSION file
5. Create a git tag
6. Commit the changes
7. Push everything to the remote repository

This process, while straightforward, was error-prone and time-consuming. I wanted something more automated, more reliable, and frankly, more elegant.

## Enter Claude Code Custom Commands

Claude Code's custom slash commands feature allows you to create reusable prompts that can be shared across your team or kept personal. There are two types:

- **Project commands** (`.claude/commands/`): Shared with your team using `/project:command-name`
- **Personal commands** (`~/.claude/commands/`): Available across all your projects using `/user:command-name`

The beauty lies in their simplicity. You create a Markdown file with your command specification, and Claude Code handles the rest.

## Building a Semantic Version Manager

I decided to create a comprehensive version management command. Here's what I built:

```markdown
# Semantic Version Manager

Manage semantic versioning for this project using a VERSION file and Git tags.

**Command arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS`

## Requirements

You are tasked with implementing semantic version management with the following specifications:

### Core Functionality
- **VERSION file management**: If VERSION file doesn't exist, create it with "0.0.1"
- **Version validation**: Read current version from VERSION file and validate it follows proper semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Git integration**: Create git tags with format "v{version}" and commit with message "Release version {version}"
- **Remote sync**: Push the tag _and_ the version commit to origin after creation

### Supported Commands
Parse the `$ARGUMENTS` and handle these subcommands:

- **`current`** - Display current version without making changes
- **`patch`** - Increment patch version (e.g., 1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
- **`minor`** - Increment minor version and reset patch (e.g., 1.2.3 → 1.3.0)
- **`major`** - Increment major version and reset minor/patch (e.g., 1.2.3 → 2.0.0)
- **`set X.Y.Z`** - Set specific version (e.g., `set 2.1.0`)
```

The magic happens with the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder. This allows the command to be flexible and handle different subcommands dynamically.

## Real-World Usage

Now, instead of going through that lengthy manual process, I simply type:

```bash
/project:version patch
```

And Claude Code handles everything:

```
✅ Updated version: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
✅ Updated VERSION file
✅ Created git tag: v1.0.1
✅ Committed: "Release version 1.0.1"
✅ Pushed tag to origin
```

For major releases, it's just as simple:

```bash
/project:version major
```

The command even includes safety features like checking for a clean working directory and graceful error handling.

## Advanced Features I Added

What started as a simple version incrementer evolved into a robust tool:

- **Dry-run mode**: Preview changes without applying them using `--dry-run`
- **Multi-format support**: Automatically updates `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, and `pyproject.toml` if present
- **Pre-release support**: Handles versions like "1.0.0-alpha.1"
- **Build metadata**: Supports build metadata like "1.0.0+build.123"
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Gracefully handles network issues, permission problems, and invalid version formats

## The Bigger Picture

Custom slash commands have proven to be incredibly flexible! My development workflow is no longer cluttered with repetitive manual tasks, and my team now has a standardized way to handle version releases across all our projects.

The real power lies in their shareability. Once I created this command, every team member could immediately benefit from the same workflow. No more "how do I tag this release again?" questions in Slack.

## Beyond Version Management

Since discovering this feature, I've created several other custom commands:

- `/project:test-coverage` - Runs tests and generates coverage reports
- `/project:deploy-staging` - Handles staging deployments with proper checks
- `/project:docs-update` - Updates documentation based on code changes

Each command encapsulates domain knowledge and best practices, making our team more efficient and consistent.

## Getting Started

Creating your own custom commands is straightforward:

1. Create a `.claude/commands` directory in your project
2. Add a Markdown file for each command (filename becomes the command name)
3. Use `$ARGUMENTS` for dynamic inputs
4. Invoke with `/project:command-name arguments`

The version management command is available in my [claude-code-custom-commands repository](https://github.com/y-a-v-a/claude-cude-custom-commands) as a starting point for your own automation journey.

## Conclusion

Claude Code's custom slash commands have fundamentally changed how I approach repetitive development tasks. What used to be error-prone manual processes are now reliable, one-line commands that my entire team can use consistently.

If you're still manually managing versions, deployments, or any other routine tasks, I highly recommend exploring custom commands. The initial investment in creating them pays dividends in reduced errors, improved consistency, and freed-up mental bandwidth for the work that actually matters.

The development workflow automation possibilities are endless – and that's exactly what makes this feature so exciting.
